# -colorful-star--recursion
This is a Python program that uses the Turtle graphics library to draw a colorful star using recursion.
This program uses the turtle module in Python to draw a fractal star with a yellow color on a black background.
It first initializes a turtle object a and sets the background color to black. 
Then it defines a function star that recursively draws five lines forming a star shape and calls itself with a smaller size to draw the smaller stars inside.
Finally, the function is called with an initial size of 360 to draw the largest star.
